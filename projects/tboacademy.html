      <!-- Overview -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          TBO Academy is an online learning platform for travel agents and tour operators. Unlike consumer B2C sites, 
          B2B educational platforms have unique SEO challenges: smaller audience, higher purchase intent, strong engagement signals. 
          Over 1.5 years, I grew organic traffic from ~2K to 20K monthly visitors by improving UI/UX, optimizing video content, 
          and building community around educational resources.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Challenge -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          B2B educational SEO is different from B2C consumer SEO:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Smaller Addressable Market:</strong> Travel agents and tour operators are a smaller audience than general consumers. Reaching them requires precision targeting.</li>
          <li><strong>Long Content Consumption:</strong> Users need to spend significant time learning. Bounce rate is not a failure metric if engagement (time-on-page, videos watched) is high.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Transaction Intent:</strong> B2B educational sites don't have "buy now" CTAs. The goal is engagement, trust-building, and eventual lead generation.</li>
          <li><strong>Video SEO Complexity:</strong> Travel agents are visual learners. Videos are critical but harder to optimize for SEO than text.</li>
          <li><strong>Niche Keywords:</strong> Search volumes are lower but more specific. "Travel agent insurance" might have 100 searches/month vs "insurance" with 1M searches.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Strategy -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Strategy & Execution</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented a content + UX + video optimization strategy:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>UI/UX Audit & Redesign:</strong> Conducted user flow analysis and found that users spent 1-2 min on learning pages before bouncing. Redesigned course layout with better navigation, progress indicators, and clearer learning paths. This improved time-on-page by 200%.</li>
          <li><strong>Video SEO Strategy:</strong> Created video transcripts for YouTube and on-site videos. Added video schema (VideoObject), chapters, and timestamps. Optimized YouTube titles and descriptions for keyword rankings. This enabled us to capture YouTube search traffic for learning-intent queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Learning Path Content:</strong> Instead of standalone articles, created structured learning paths (beginner → intermediate → advanced). Interconnected with semantic internal links to guide users through the curriculum and increase session duration.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Added user comments, Q&A sections, and instructor responses to boost engagement signals. High engagement (comments, shares) improved rankings and user retention.</li>
          <li><strong>Niche Keyword Focus:</strong> Targeted specific travel agent pain points (e.g., "How to get travel agency license", "Travel insurance for agents", "Tour costing spreadsheet"). Lower volume but higher intent and conversion.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Daily Work -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Daily Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keyword Research:</strong> Conducted niche keyword research targeting travel agent queries. Analyzed search intent and prioritized high-intent, lower-volume keywords.</li>
          <li><strong>Video Optimization:</strong> Created video transcripts, optimized YouTube metadata, added video schema markup. Tracked video watch time and click-through rates as engagement metrics.</li>
          <li><strong>UX Audits (Bi-weekly):</strong> Analyzed user behavior using Google Analytics and heatmaps. Identified pages with high bounce rates and low engagement. Proposed UX improvements and worked with product team on implementation.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Briefs:</strong> Created SEO-optimized content briefs for course creators. Included target keywords, learning objectives, and internal linking recommendations.</li>
          <li><strong>Internal Linking:</strong> Built semantic internal linking between related courses and learning paths to guide users and improve crawl efficiency.</li>
          <li><strong>Reporting (Weekly):</strong> Built Looker Studio dashboards tracking ranking changes, organic traffic, engagement metrics (time-on-page, video views, scroll depth), and learning completion rates.</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Learnings -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>For B2B educational sites, engagement metrics matter more than rankings. Focus on time-on-page, scroll depth, and video watch time.</li>
          <li>Video is critical for B2B education. Ranking videos in YouTube search and Google Video results can drive 30-40% of organic traffic.</li>
          <li>UX improvements directly impact SEO. Better navigation and clearer learning paths improve engagement, which improves rankings.</li>
          <li>B2B audiences are smaller but higher-intent. Niche keywords with lower volume often convert better than broad keywords.</li>
          <li>Community (comments, Q&A, reviews) is a ranking signal for educational content. Encourage interaction and respond to comments.</li>
        </ul>
