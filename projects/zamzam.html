      <!-- Overview -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          ZamZam.com is an e-commerce platform for Umrah and religious travel packages. The challenge was launching a new brand 
          in a highly competitive niche dominated by established travel agencies. Working closely with the development team from 
          pre-launch through full scale, I built an SEO foundation that enabled the site to achieve 600K monthly organic visits 
          and 200+ featured snippets within the first year.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Challenge -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          Building SEO for a new e-commerce site from scratch presented unique obstacles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Zero Domain Authority:</strong> No backlinks, no brand history, no trust signals. Competing against established travel sites with years of authority.</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive Niche:</strong> Umrah and religious travel have high buyer intent and high CPC, attracting well-funded competitors.</li>
          <li><strong>Technical Decisions at Scale:</strong> E-commerce sites have thousands of URLs (products, reviews, guides). Wrong structural choices impact thousands of pages.</li>
          <li><strong>Thin Content Risk:</strong> Product pages without unique value get penalized. Balancing descriptions with unique insights is critical.</li>
          <li><strong>Launch Timing:</strong> Site needed to be SEO-ready from day one. Post-launch fixes are 10x harder to implement at scale.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Strategy -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Strategy & Execution</h2>
        <p>
          I took a pre-launch and launch-phase approach:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pre-Launch Collaboration:</strong> Worked with developers 4-6 weeks before launch to design URL structure, implement breadcrumbs, set up XML sitemaps, and establish internal linking patterns. This ensured crawlability and indexation from day one.</li>
          <li><strong>Featured Snippet Strategy:</strong> Analyzed competitor content and identified "zero-click" search opportunities (e.g., "How much does Umrah cost", "Best time to go Umrah", "Umrah visa process"). Created comprehensive guides and comparison pages targeting these questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Long-Tail Keyword Focus:</strong> Instead of competing for "Umrah packages" (too competitive), targeted long-tail queries like "5-star Umrah packages under 1 lakh", "Umrah packages from Delhi", "Ramadan Umrah deals". These had lower CPC and higher conversion intent.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Clusters:</strong> Organized content into thematic clusters (e.g., "Umrah for beginners" → includes visa guides, packing lists, step-by-step walkthroughs). Interconnected with semantic internal links to build topical authority.</li>
          <li><strong>Off-Page Authority:</strong> Executed targeted link-building through PR submissions to travel blogs, travel niche directories, and high-authority Indian directories. Also created infographics (e.g., "Umrah Checklist") and contributed guest posts to build early backlinks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Daily Work -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Daily Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Keyword Research (Pre-Launch):</strong> Used Semrush and Ahrefs to map out 1000+ target keywords across product, informational, and transactional intent. Prioritized by volume, difficulty, and conversion potential.</li>
          <li><strong>Dev Coordination:</strong> Provided technical SEO specifications to developers including meta tag requirements, schema markup (Product, Review, FAQ), canonical tag placement, and mobile optimization.</li>
          <li><strong>Content Gap Analysis:</strong> Compared our planned content against top competitors. Identified gaps where we could create more comprehensive guides than competitors.</li>
          <li><strong>On-Page Optimization:</strong> Wrote/guided content for high-value pages ensuring keyword optimization, natural language, compelling CTAs, and internal links.</li>
          <li><strong>Link Building Campaign:</strong> Coordinated outreach to travel blogs, niche directories, and authority sites. Created link-worthy assets (e.g., "Complete Umrah Planning Guide", "Umrah Cost Breakdown Infographic").</li>
          <li><strong>Ranking Tracking (Weekly):</strong> Monitored keyword rankings and identified quick wins (pages on verge of ranking). Optimized these pages for quick ranking boosts.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Learnings -->
      <section class="project-detail-section">
        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pre-launch SEO collaboration with developers is worth 10x more than post-launch fixes. Get it right from day one.</li>
          <li>For competitive niches, long-tail keywords are your friend. Higher conversion, lower competition, faster ranking wins.</li>
          <li>Featured snippets are a ranking signal. Sites that dominate answer boxes tend to grow faster overall.</li>
          <li>Thematic content clusters with strong internal linking build topical authority faster than scattered, unrelated content.</li>
          <li>Link building is still important for new sites. Quality early links from relevant sources dramatically accelerate growth.</li>
